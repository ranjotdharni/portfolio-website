# Overview

This repository houses the source code for my portfolio website. The application is deployed to **Netlify** as a staticly served HTML page generated from a **React** build. The site provides relevant details on my career as a web developer and gives an overview of some of the projects that I've undertaken. Many of the effects you will find in the site are made using a combination of **Three.js** and **Spline 3D.** For more information on how to make 3D effects like you see in the site on your own, please visit the relevant links for [Three.js][threeLink] and [Spline][splineLink].
